# Superstore_Sales_Analysis
This project is a business intelligence case study on Superstore, a fictional U.S.-based retail company specializing in Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology products.

As an aspiring Business Analyst, I analyzed the Superstore dataset (2009-2012) to uncover insights into sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and product trends. My objective was to practice solving real-world business problems using data-driven approaches and to highlight how BI tools can support growth and profitability strategies.
