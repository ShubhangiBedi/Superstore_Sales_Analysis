# Superstore_Sales_Analysis
This project is a business intelligence case study on Superstore, a fictional U.S.-based retail company specializing in Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology products.

As an aspiring Business Analyst, I analyzed the Superstore dataset (2009-2012) to uncover insights into sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and product trends. My objective was to practice solving real-world business problems using data-driven approaches and to highlight how BI tools can support growth and profitability strategies.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

Source: Kaggle
Features: Order details, customer info, product data, and geographical attributes
Cleaning: No missing values, irrelevant data removed, and 1 duplicate dropped

KPIs:
â€¢ Over the past four years, Superstore generated $14.92 million in revenue but only had a gross profit of $1.52 million. The company's average discount stood at 4.97%, suggesting that the discounting strategy might have influenced the profit margin. A detailed breakdown of the profit margin within the discount category will be explored later in the Financial Analysis dashboard.

Sales by Region and state:
â€¢ The West region boasted the highest revenue, with sales amounting to 3.6 million, followed by the Ontario region with sales of $3.05 million. Therefore, the company should focus on marketing efforts and optimizing inventory in those regions to further increase sales.

Sales vs. Profit by Category and Sub-Category:
â€¢ The Office machine sub-category stood out with impressive sales and profit figures.
